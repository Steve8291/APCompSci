# Note: To crack both you will need to concatenate all the dictionaries I gave you.
# Bruna knows how to do this.
# The dictionary Yehor created does not contain all the files!
# I will leave my computer on and connected to the "topsecret" network.
# Yehor has cracked the password to the "hack-me" network and he can connect to it.
# Just ask him to connect when you are ready to sniff packets.
# Yehor if you want to leave your laptop or chromebook connected to "hack-me"
# that would be helpful.
