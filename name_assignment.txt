Create a program that will allow the user to select how many random names they want from a list.
The program will then output that many namess
Think about how to make the output useful and readable.
Your program must never give the user a duplicate name.
Your program must be executable from the terminal.
Your program should have a name that makes sense.
Example: The user tells the program to return two unique random names and it prints those out.

Testing:
	What happens if a user provides a string rather than an int?
	What happens if they provide a number that is too high or too low?
	
Advanced:	
	Is there some way to tell the user how many names are left in the list?
	Can you then keep the program running so that they can continue to get new random names that don't repeat?


You are allowed to hard code the names into the program:
	Mason Reeves
	Cesar Quintero-Chavez
	Mikhail Machavariana
	Yehor Ivanenko
	Cavan Stilson
	Vicky Weng
	Lucynda Destin
	Bruna Carreira
	Alex Bloom
	Philip Mattern
	Jahir Arellano Ferrer
	Jorge  Luis Lagos-Mendoza
	Avalon Henrichsen
	Grace Lykins
	Josh Saewert
	Jesse Isaacs
	Grace Hale
	Greta Hemmerlein
